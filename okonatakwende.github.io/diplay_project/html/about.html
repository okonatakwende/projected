      <b>About me and my game</b>
<hr>
      <p>
       My name is Okona Kwende and I live in Albany California. In the hidden genius projet I have been taking a ccourse on developing 
       videogames. With the help on my instructor  Jabari I made a 2d sidescroller game this summer. The objective is to avoid enemies by 
       throwing projectiles or jumping over them and collecting the items along the way to get points such as emeralds and gold coins.

<p>My Process</p>
<hr>
<p>When making my game I mostly followed the instructions of my instructor but I had a lot of technical difficulties
  in thye beggening and the end which was frustrating. I made my custom bakckground in the animattion track using adobe 
  illustrator. It was pretty simple and only took around 10 minutes. When i chose the animation and videogame track the 
  only thing that I really wanted to do was the animations because I knew I would get very frustrated during the videogame track(which I did a lot)
