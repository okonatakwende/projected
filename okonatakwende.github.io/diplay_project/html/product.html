        With the skills that I learned in the videogame track I will keep learning about videogames so I can make a game
        I have been wanting to make for a while. The game would be a team shooter combined with rpg and battle royale elements and would be
        in third person.The map would be a large maze and there would be multiple teams made up of 3 or 4 people. Teams would go through the mase
        fighting npcs and getting powerups so they can prepare for fights with other teams. When a team encounters another they will be
        locked into a match and put in a mini map where they will have to use what they collected to win. The winner of the match will 
        be teleported back to the main maze and the last team who survives is the winner.
      
      </p>

<b>This is how a match would go</b>
<ul>
    <li>4 teams of 3 or 4 people will load into the lbby</li>
    <li>They all get dropped into the maze</li>
    <li>They all fight mosters and other players until 1 team reamins</li>
    <li>After the match the winners get a large xp boost(the top 3 teams get a higher xp boost while the lower ones get small ones)</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <b>Ranking System</b>

<p>In my game there would be 10 levels of ranking and players would be able to choose if they want to play 
a ranked match or a casual match. As the players rank up the xp they get towards their rank o decrease and any losses will
result in a decrease of rank.
</p>

<b>Weapons</b>
<p>In early development there would on be 10 to 15 weapons max but if the game becomes succesful I would add more weapons 
    in updates 
    The basic weapons would be shotguns, sidearms, lmg's, assault rifles, and sniper rifles.
    There would be grenades in the game as well. At the beggeing only a couple would be included.
    <ul>
        <li>Flash Bang</li>
        <li>Smoke Grenade</li>
        <li>Decoy Grendade</li>
        <li>Frag</li>
      </ul>
</p>
